# ðŸ“‚ Self Projects

Welcome to my personal portfolio of data science and analytics projects.  
This repository acts as a **hub**, showcasing all my projects in one place.  

Each project has its own repository containing:
- **Raw Data** 
- **Code / Notebooks** 
- **Presentation** 
- **Project README** with details and insights

## ðŸ“Œ Projects

### 1. [Python Gaming Hub](https://github.com/MukkiV/Python-Game-Hub)
- **Goal:** Create a terminal-based gaming hub in Python that allows users to play multiple mini-games from a single interface.  
- **Dataset:** No external dataset used â€” games are implemented using Python logic.  
- **Steps Taken:**
  - Designed a **modular structure** using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
  - Implemented an **abstract base class (ABC)** to define the structure for all mini-games.  
  - Built multiple games (e.g. Rock-Paper-Scissors, Number Guessing, etc.).  
  - Developed a **main menu system** to let users select and play games interactively.  
  - Ensured **code reusability and scalability** so new games can be added easily.  
- **Tools:** Python, OOP principles, `abc` module, random module  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Showcases understanding of **polymorphism** and **inheritance** in Python.  
  - A single hub where players can switch between games without restarting the program.  
  - Structured as a learning + fun project to practice clean code and modular design.

### 2. [Retail Project](https://github.com/MukkiV/Retail-Project)
- **Goal:** Analyze retail transaction, product, and demographic data to identify sales patterns and customer insights.  
- **Dataset:** Transaction data (`transactions.csv`), product details (`product.csv`), and customer demographics (`hh_demographic.csv`).  
- **Steps Taken:**
  - Imported and optimized large datasets by selecting relevant columns and reducing data types for efficiency.  
  - Performed **time-based analysis**:
    - Aggregated sales by month and compared trends across 2016 and 2017.  
    - Identified weekday vs weekend sales differences.  
  - Conducted **demographic analysis**:
    - Grouped sales by customer age and income categories.  
    - Analyzed average sales per household composition.  
  - Integrated product-level data:
    - Linked products with demographics to study department-wise sales preferences.  
    - Identified which product categories were most popular among younger demographics.  
  - Exported final pivot tables and insights to Excel for reporting.  
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Excel (for exporting).  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Found that sales were **growing over time** but varied seasonally.  
  - High-income households contributed significantly more to total sales.  
  - Younger customers showed strong preferences in specific product categories.

### 3. [Hotel Booking Analysis](https://github.com/MukkiV/Hotel-Booking-Analysis)
- **Goal:** Analyze hotel booking data to uncover customer booking patterns, cancellation behavior, and factors influencing reservations.  
- **Dataset:** Hotel booking dataset containing details such as hotel type, booking dates, lead time, number of guests, market segment, cancellations, and special requests.  
- **Steps Taken:**
  - Performed **data cleaning** (handled missing values, corrected data types, and removed duplicates).  
  - Analyzed **booking patterns**:
    - Distribution of bookings across city hotels and resort hotels.  
    - Seasonal trends in bookings and peak months.  
    - Lead time analysis to understand advance booking behavior.  
  - Conducted **cancellation analysis**:
    - Explored factors contributing to cancellations (lead time, deposit type, market segment).  
    - Compared cancellation rates between city hotels and resort hotels.  
  - Studied **guest demographics**:
    - Family vs solo bookings.  
    - Impact of repeated guests on hotel bookings.  
  - Created meaningful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Found that **city hotels had higher bookings but also higher cancellations**.  
  - Longer **lead times were strongly correlated with cancellations**.  
  - Peak booking periods aligned with summer and holiday seasons.  
  - Insights can help hotels improve **marketing strategies and reduce cancellations**.
