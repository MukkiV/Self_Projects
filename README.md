## ðŸ“Œ Projects

### 1. [Python Gaming Hub](https://github.com/yourusername/python-gaming-hub)
- **Goal:** Create a terminal-based gaming hub in Python that allows users to play multiple mini-games from a single interface.  
- **Dataset:** No external dataset used â€” games are implemented using Python logic.  
- **Steps Taken:**
  - Designed a **modular structure** using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
  - Implemented an **abstract base class (ABC)** to define the structure for all mini-games.  
  - Built multiple games (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Rock-Paper-Scissors, Number Guessing, etc.).  
  - Developed a **main menu system** to let users select and play games interactively.  
  - Ensured **code reusability and scalability** so new games can be added easily.  
- **Tools:** Python, OOP principles, `abc` module, random module  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Showcases understanding of **polymorphism** and **inheritance** in Python.  
  - A single hub where players can switch between games without restarting the program.  
  - Structured as a learning + fun project to practice clean code and modular design.
